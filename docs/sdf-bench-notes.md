# SDF perf-bench notes

The `sdf.bench` instrument (an async per-frame runner inside the SDF-debug mode —
`src/Puck.Demo/SdfDebug/SdfBenchScene.cs`) measures per-pass GPU cost of the world
render path. It emits a workload, warms W frames, samples M frames of the existing
`TryReadPassTimings`, and prints a fixed-width table of median + min/max for
frame/beam/views/composite. Drive it over stdin:

```
PUCK_TIMING=1 dotnet run --project src/Puck.Demo -c Release -- --exit-after-seconds 200 \
  < docs/examples/scripts/sdf-bench.console
```

Verbs: `sdf.bench shapes | ops | instances <shape> <n> | sweep [shape] | warm <n> |
frames <n> | abort` (the mode must be active — run `sdf` first). Camera is a FIXED
deterministic pose per configuration (constant yaw/pitch; distance computed to frame
the whole workload at the 50° render FOV), so numbers are pad-independent.

---

## 2026-07-08 — first exploration (the beam-slope measurement)

Host: **Vulkan, 1280×800, warm=8 samples=32**, machine otherwise idle. All times in
milliseconds; medians with (min–max). `composite` is negligible throughout (<0.1 ms)
and is omitted from the discussion.

### Capacity-probe envelope (the cost of always reserving 4096 instance slots)

Measured at render assembly (`OverworldFrameSource.MeasureWorstCaseEnvelope`), the two
probes and the frozen envelope = their MAX (the mode's takeover is the room's debug
subject OR a bench workload, never both):

| Probe | words | instances |
|---|---|---|
| room + debug subject (all screens, creator pool, companions) | 799,400 | 418 |
| bench worst case (4096 lifted Stars) | 311,320 | 4096 |
| **frozen envelope (max)** | **799,400** (~3.05 MB) | **4096** |

- **Program-word capacity is UNCHANGED** (~3.05 MB): the room's own worst case already
  dominated; the 4096-instance bench probe (311,320 words, ~1.19 MB) fits under it.
- **Instance capacity rose 418 → 4096.** This is the only real cost: it resizes the
  per-tile instance-mask buffer from ⌈418/32⌉=14 to ⌈4096/32⌉=128 words/tile. At
  1280×800 the tile grid is 80×50 = 4000 tiles (TileSize 16); the engine reserves
  `MaxViewports`=5 slots, so the mask buffer grows from **~1.12 MB to ~10.24 MB — a
  one-time +9.1 MB static allocation**.
- **Per-frame cost is UNCHANGED by the reservation.** The beam/views push the LIVE
  program's mask width (`pushWords[7] = m_liveInstanceMaskWordCount`), never the
  reserved 128, so a normal room frame still iterates ~14 words/tile. The parked-slot
  contract holds: reserved-but-inactive slots cost nothing per frame. (Confirmed by the
  sweep below — a 64-instance frame costs 8.9 ms even though 4096 slots are reserved.)

Single fullscreen shapes are **world-level** (no instances), so `beam` is just the tile
cone-prepass and stays under ~0.7 ms for every primitive — the cost is entirely in
`views` (the per-pixel VM interpretation + shading). Note this is **cost as framed** at
the bench's fixed distance: it conflates per-eval ALU with how much screen the shape
covers and how many march steps its silhouette costs, so it is not a pure per-instruction
ALU ranking. Rough `views` grouping (ms):

- **Cheapest (~0.8–2.6):** Ellipse, Capsule, Cylinder, Ellipsoid — compact silhouettes,
  short marches.
- **Mid (~3.5–4.9):** Vesica, Sphere, Box, RoundCone.
- **Costliest (~5.3–6.1):** Star, Polygon, Trapezoid, RoundedRect, Torus — the torus
  annulus and the lifted 2D family (revolved profiles with grazing near-silhouette
  marches) cost the most as framed.

(The wide `min–max` on Capsule/Trapezoid are the first post-config-switch frames while
the camera pose settles — the median is robust to them.)

### (b) Per-op marginal cost — fixed torus + one op (`sdf.bench ops`)

```

Marginal cost = op `views` − baseline `views` (2.93 ms). Two important caveats:
**(1)** a domain-fold op changes the SCENE, not just the ALU — a space-filling fold
makes rays converge faster (or fills the screen with more surface), so the delta is the
op's total effect on the framed frame, not a pure per-instruction ALU cost. **(2)** the
torus is the ONE fixed subject; another subject would reweight the coverage terms.

- **Costliest additions:** Wallpaper **+5.2**, LogSphere **+4.8** (both genuinely heavy
  per-eval — many fold branches / transcendentals — AND they tile the screen with
  surface), then Onion **+2.9**, Elongate **+2.8** ≈ DomainWarp **+2.8**, Dilate **+2.0**.
- **Cheap additions:** BendX +1.0 ≈ Scale +0.9, Twist +0.7, CellJitter +0.3, Displace ≈0.
- **NEGATIVE (make the framed scene cheaper):** RepeatLimited **−1.2**, Polar −0.9,
  Symmetry −0.7, Repeat −0.4 — the fold is cheap per-eval and tiles space so first-hit
  rays terminate sooner (and their beam drops to ~0.1 ms as the field fills every tile).

### (c) THE BEAM-SLOPE ANSWER — instance sweep (`sdf.bench sweep torus`)

```
  config             | frame med (min-max)        |      beam |     views | composite
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Torus x64          |   8.866 (  7.479- 10.000)  |     3.282 |     5.516 |     0.015
  Torus x256         |  19.161 ( 18.031- 20.882)  |    12.502 |     6.650 |     0.011
  Torus x1024        |  68.316 ( 65.589- 69.332)  |    50.666 |    17.996 |     0.011
  Torus x4096        | 243.891 (242.798-249.049)  |   187.333 |    56.222 |     0.012
```

**Yes — `sdf-beam` grows essentially LINEARLY with instance count.** Beam factor per 4×
step: 64→256 **3.81×**, 256→1024 **4.05×**, 1024→4096 **3.70×** (mean ≈3.85× per 4× ⇒
exponent ≈0.97, i.e. ~O(n)). This is exactly the expected shape of the per-tile cull:
the beam cone-tests every instance's bound sphere in every tile, so its cost is
O(tiles × instances).

**Where does beam dominate frame time?** From **n ≈ 256**. At n=64 views still leads
(5.5 vs 3.3 ms). At n=256 beam (12.5) overtakes views (6.7) and is 65 % of the frame;
at n=1024 it is 74 %; at n=4096 it is **77 %** of a 244 ms frame (≈4 fps). Views grows
sub-linearly at first (fixed per-pixel cost) and trends toward linear at scale
(1.20× → 2.71× → 3.12× per 4×) as more instances mean more mask-enumerated segments per
pixel — but beam is the dominant term everywhere past ~256.

### Implication for D3 / the uniform-grid cull (survey row 15) and the 16384 question

The measured **linear beam slope is the measure-gate verdict**: because beam is
O(tiles × instances), extrapolating the 4096 = 187 ms beam linearly puts **16384 (4×) at
~750 ms of beam alone (~1.3 fps)** — untenable interactively. So raising the cap to
16384 is **NOT plausible on the current path**; the O(instances-per-tile) cone test is
precisely what a deterministic **uniform-grid cull (survey row 15)** replaces with an
O(instances-in-nearby-cells) test. The grid cull is the gate before 16384.

**Memory is NOT the blocker.** At 16384 the mask is ⌈16384/32⌉ = 512 words/tile = 2 KB/
tile — matching the expected figure — for a total of 5 × 4000 × 2 KB ≈ **41 MB**, which
is affordable. So the honest reading is: the mask memory at 16384 is fine; the linear
**beam compute** is what makes 16384 implausible without the grid cull. Conversely, 4096
is comfortably usable for a static hero shot (~4 fps) but wants the grid cull well before
it becomes a real-time budget — beam already owns 77 % of a 4096 frame.
