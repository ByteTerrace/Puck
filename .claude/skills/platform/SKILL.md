# Platform

A map of where Puck meets the operating system. Three projects, one shape:

- **`Puck.Platform`** holds the OS-neutral contracts and the pieces that need
  no OS code: window, clipboard, camera, image-capture and audio-render
  contracts, camera discovery polling, the unmanaged allocator, probe
  readings and kernel sockets, null fallbacks and the declining recording
  factories.
- **`Puck.Platform.Windows`** implements them over Win32, Media Foundation,
  Windows Graphics Capture, WASAPI, Raw Input, HID, XInput and GameInput.
- **`Puck.Platform.Linux`** implements windows over Wayland and XCB and
  registers null or declining services for everything else.

A composition root picks one platform per seam with one
`OperatingSystem.IsWindows()` branch (`WorldBootComposition`, and
`WindowsPresentationRegistration` or `LinuxPresentationRegistration` in the
`Puck.Launcher.Windows` and `.Linux` projects). The project READMEs
([neutral](../../../src/Puck.Platform/README.md),
[Windows](../../../src/Puck.Platform.Windows/README.md),
[Linux](../../../src/Puck.Platform.Linux/README.md)) are the developer
reference. When this file and the code disagree, the code wins and this file is
corrected in the same change.

## Registration shape

- `PlatformWindowingServiceRegistration.AddPlatformWindowing` registers only
  the neutral pieces (display probe, platform support, window factory). Each
  platform package adds one method per seam:
  `WindowsPlatformServiceRegistration.AddWindowsPlatformWindowing`,
  `AddWindowsCameraCapture`, `AddWindowsRecordingPlatform`,
  `AddWindowsAudioRender`, `AddWindowsPrecisionWaiter`, and the Linux
  equivalents on `LinuxPlatformServiceRegistration`
  (`AddLinuxPlatformWindowing`, `AddLinuxCameraCapture`, which registers the
  null camera and image-capture services today, `AddLinuxRecordingPlatform`).
  A new backend implements the contract in its platform project and replaces
  the null service in that platform's registration method.
- A method that constructs a `[SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]` type carries
  the attribute itself, so CA1416 makes the caller guard with
  `OperatingSystem.IsWindows()`. The guard lives in the composition root,
  never inside a platform project.
- `Puck.Platform.Windows` stays `net11.0`, like `Puck.Platform`, so the
  annotations keep firing. `WindowsCaptureProjection.targets` re-declares the
  WinRT projection at every entry point that references it, on Windows hosts.
- A seam with no backend registers a null or declining service that answers
  with a reason (`NullCameraCaptureService`, `DecliningVideoEncoderFactory`),
  never a missing service a caller must guess about.

## Play nice with the host

AGENTS.md's ruling applies here first: Puck uses the host's threads, waits,
timers and virtual memory, and never spins in place of a wait or raises
process-wide timer resolution. In this area that means:

- Wait on `IPrecisionWaiter`. `Win32HighResolutionWaitableTimer` uses
  `CREATE_WAITABLE_TIMER_HIGH_RESOLUTION`, which wakes within about half a
  millisecond without `timeBeginPeriod` and without spinning;
  `LauncherHostLoop.WaitUntil` re-reads its clock after each wait and falls
  back to a one-millisecond sleep where no waiter exists. A busy loop on a
  stopwatch is a defect, however short.
- Swap-chain waits pace a windowed host ([host pacing](../../../docs/reference/hosting.md#host-pacing));
  the timer only bounds what the swap chain cannot.
- Camera graphs own their native objects on one MTA worker thread, joined with
  a bound on disposal; camera scans run at most one at a time on a worker and
  hand back completed snapshots without blocking the caller.
- The window holds a display-required power request while open, because a
  powered-off display stops the compositor retiring presents.

## Contracts that bite

- **An empty camera list means no cameras.** `EnumerateDevices` returns empty
  only when the machine has none; a failed scan throws
  `InvalidOperationException`, so a caller never reads a failed scan as every
  camera unplugged.
- **A successful open is usable.** A pixel open has already published a frame
  from every stream; a shared open has validated native GPU input. A shared
  ring's consumer acquires a slot until its GPU submission retires, and the
  camera drops a frame rather than overwrite a texture still being sampled.
- **Relative mouse motion is never integrated into a cursor estimate.** Raw
  Input supplies per-mouse deltas; the system cursor supplies positions and
  buttons.
- **An agent's World opens no physical device.** `--devices none` drops every
  OS event before a seat; never inject real input to test
  ([puck-world](../puck-world/SKILL.md#an-agents-world-opens-no-physical-device)).
- **A device or OS protocol is independent work.** Consult several
  independent sources (vendor documentation, kernel drivers, other open
  implementations), cite each and note where they disagree (AGENTS.md).

## Where each contract is enforced

| Contract | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| Windows-only code runs only behind an OS guard | CA1416 over `[SupportedOSPlatform]` on the registration methods |
| `Puck.Platform.Linux`'s closure has no Windows dependency | the `Puck.Platform.Linux` lane profile in `build/Architecture.props` (`puck architecture`) |
| A failed camera scan is distinct from an empty one | `ICameraCaptureService.EnumerateDevices` throwing; `CameraDeviceScanner` keeping failures apart from empty lists |
| One waiter per timer, no spinning | `Win32HighResolutionWaitableTimer` (one waiter at a time, re-armed per wait) |

## Open gaps

- **Linux has no camera, desktop-capture, audio-render, video-encoder,
  audio-capture or clipboard backend**, and its windows hold no display
  request (Wayland's idle inhibit, X11's screensaver suspend). Windowed
  Wayland and XCB behaviour has not been run on real Linux hardware.
- **Duplicates recorded in the refactoring packet:** camera plane validation
  and L8/BGRA packing (`Win32FaceAuthenticationCameraGraph.cs` beside
  `CameraFramePacking`), and the latest-value seqlock (`ProbeReadingRing`
  beside `Puck.Hosting`'s `PublishBuffer<T>`)
  ([refactoring campaign](../../../docs/plans/open-items.md#refactoring-campaign)).
- A reading taken while the compositor is not composing still looks like a
  slow frame ([open items](../../../docs/plans/open-items.md)).

## Verify

- Build what you touched: `dotnet build src/Puck.Platform.Windows -c Release`
  or `src/Puck.Platform.Linux`; a Linux change also gets the WSL2 build the
  [Linux launcher README](../../../src/Puck.Launcher.Linux/README.md) gives,
  and says what it does not prove.
- Laws: `tests/Puck.Platform.Windows.Tests` (camera enumeration and pixel
  delivery skip on a machine with no colour camera), and the host-loop laws in
  `tests/Puck.Launcher.Tests` (`OffscreenBoundaryLawTests` drives a manual
  `IPrecisionWaiter`).
- A window, a display, a camera or pointer lock is a windowed World, a GPU leg
  (`verification`); hand it back as a verification request unless your brief
  grants it.

## Look-alikes

- Host pacing decisions (swap chain, timer grid, catch-up bursts) belong to
  `Puck.Launcher` and the hosting reference; this area only supplies the waits
  and display facts they read.
- `Puck.Input` turns transports into `InputSignal`s and binds them (`input`);
  this area only acquires devices and window events.
- Camera capture feeds screens and probes; `capture.*` records the game
  (`media`).

## Route adjacent work

| Skill | Route there for |
|---|---|
| `input` | Gamepads, HID protocols, haptics, `InputArbiter`, window input mapping and bindings. |
| `media` | The audio device's mixer and director, recording sessions, encoders as the recording graph uses them. |
| `rendering` | Swap chains, presenters, the frame pacer, shared GPU textures a camera ring feeds, the camera conversion shader. |
| `puck-world` | Screens that show a camera or desktop feed, probes rows, booting a windowed World. |
| `dotnet-performance` | Allocation and interop cost on a platform hot path. |
| `verification` | GPU legs for windowed checks, the private CLI copy. |
